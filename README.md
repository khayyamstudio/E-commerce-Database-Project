# E-Commerce Database Project

A **relational database system** built in **PostgreSQL** to simulate a realistic e-commerce platform.  
The project models **Users, Products, Orders, Payments, and Addresses** (fully normalized in 3NF), includes sample data, advanced queries, and an ER diagram—perfect for showcasing database design and SQL skills.

## Key Features

- **Normalized Schema (3NF):**  
  Separate tables for City, State, and Country for clean and scalable address management.
- **Core Entities:** Users, Products, Orders, Order_Items, Payments, Addresses.
- **Sample Dataset:** 5 users, multiple products, orders, and payments to simulate real-world transactions.
- **SQL Query Bank:**  
  - Customer purchase history  
  - Top-selling products  
  - Monthly and category-wise sales reports  
  - Orders by city/state  
  - Pending payments
- **ER Diagram:** Visual representation of all entities and relationships.

## How to Run

1. Create a PostgreSQL database using **pgAdmin** or **psql**.  
2. Execute `schema/create_tables.sql` to create all tables.  
3. Load `schema/sample_data.sql` to populate sample data.  
4. Explore queries in `queries/query_bank.sql` to analyze data.  
5. Refer to `diagrams/er_diagram.png` for schema visualization.
